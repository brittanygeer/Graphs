# Graphs
A project led by the instructional team of CS 251 at Purdue University. Implements various properties of graphs and spanning trees, such as shortest path and strongly connected components.

I worked on the implmentation in four files: graph.cpp, max_height.cpp, color_walk.cpp, and scc.cpp. The skeleton code was created by the CS251 instructional team.

Part 0: Graph Implmentation:

Implmented supporting functions in graph.cpp that supports non-simple, directed or undirected graphs with edge weights.

Part 1: Maximum Height in a Road Network:

In max_height.cpp, determines the maximum height a vehicle can have, to travel from any city to any city in the network. Nodes represent cities and edge weights represent the height constraints on a vehicle.

Part 2: Color Coordinated Weighted Shortest Walk:

In color_walk.cpp, finds the color coordinated weighted shortest walk, where we must traverse from R -> G -> B.

Part 3: Clustering Web Pages Within a Website:

In scc.cpp, develops a tool that analyzes a website's structure by identifying strongly connected components (SCCs) in its internal hyperlink graph.
